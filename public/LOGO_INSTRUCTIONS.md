# Logo Setup Instructions

To use your logo on the website:

1. Save your logo file as `logo.png` in this folder (`/public/`)
2. Supported formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.svg`
3. Recommended size: 200x200px or larger (square format works best)
4. The logo will automatically appear in both the Student and Admin headers

**Note:** If you use a different filename or format, update the image source in:
- `src/pages/StudentHome.jsx` - Change `src="/logo.png"` to your filename
- `src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx` - Change `src="/logo.png"` to your filename

The logo will be displayed in a glassmorphic container with proper sizing and styling.
